## Generating Components

You can generate components from SVGs in two ways:

- By launching `./bin/index.js` and passing `--output` and `--src` (**NOTE**: `output`: will be the folder where generated files are stored. `src`: is the folder with all svgs)
- By moving all the SVGs into `./icons` inside the project dir and running `npm run generate-icons`
